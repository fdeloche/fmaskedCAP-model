abstract = {In guinea pigs the unit contribution (unit action potential, ap) to the response of the round window was computed following the method used by Kiang and co-workers (1976), i.e., fibre discharges registered by a microelectrode in the nerve were used as trigger pulses for the averaging process of the corresponding ap registered with a gross electrode at the round window. Normally the ap was independent of the fibre-CF, had a diphasic waveform, and its amplitude was about 0.1 $\mu$V. Small inter-animal differences were found in waveform and amplitude of the ap. In a pilot experiment exploring pathological influences on ap, the auditory nerve was stretched to mimic the effect of some acoustic nerve tumors. We found that the waveforms of both ap and compound action potential (CAP) changed. The results indicate that in normal guinea pig cochleas the existence of an elementary unit waveform can be used in the convolution of the CAP [Goldstein, M.H. Jr. and Kiang, N.Y.S. (1958) J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 30, 107-114]. In abnormal cochleas, however, deteriorated aps may disturb the simple convolution concept of the CAP. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {A two-interval forced-choice method was developed that provides a rapid and objective computerized measurement of the threshold for detection of the N1 peak of the compound action potential (CAP) recorded in response to a probe tone. The CAP was recorded at the round window of anesthetized chinchillas and several gerbils. An adaptive threshold-tracking procedure was verified by comparing measured thresholds to those obtained from neurometric functions, which plot the proportion of correct detections of the probe as a function of probe intensity. The adaptive procedure was applied in a forward masking paradigm to study the growth of masking of the CAP as a function of masker intensity. Results indicate that growth of masking of the CAP more closely corresponds to that observed psychophysically, than does forward masking observed in the response of a single neuron. Implications for neural encoding mechanisms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {In electrocochleography, compound action potentials (AP) are recorded from the human promontory and the guinea pig round window. High-pass noise masking and subtraction of AP responses at various high-pass cutoff frequencies give the narrow band contributions to the whole nerve AP. Although the narrowband contributions recorded from human and guinea pig ears differ essentially this narrow band concept makes it possible to derive a response area for a given type of stimulus, e.g., tone bursts. Within the response area, any combination of stimulus intensity and site on the cochlear partition evokes a detectable narrow band response contributing to the whole-nerve AP. The main part of this contribution shifts basally the higher the stimulus intensity. Latency differences between responses from the various narrow bands are used to calculate the traveling-wave velocity for the human cochlea, which ranges from about 20 m/sec at 10 kHz to 1 m/sec at 500 Hz. The amplitude and width of the narrow band responses are closely related to the traveling-wave velocity in the narrow band. It is argued that the response area and the narrow band-response concept offer a means to relate electrocochleography in the human subject to the results obtained from single-fiber studies in the normal and pathological animal cochlea.

abstract = {Compound action potentials (AP) were recorded under various stimulus conditions in 31 guinea pigs. Stimulus attenuation, decrease of inter-stimulus interval, increase of the level of a continuous wide-band noise masker, and lowering of the animal's temperature all resulted in a drop of the AP amplitude and an increase in latency. A narrow-band analysis of the compound APs makes it possible to describe these AP changes in terms of the response behaviour of small cochlear regions according to their central frequencies. The results show that intensity-dependent changes in the AP parameters can be explained on the basis of the tuning properties of the auditory nerve fibres when the effect of the rise time of the toneburst stimulus is taken into account. Shortening of the inter-stimulus interval produces a complex interaction in terms of tone-burst frequency and the region along the cochlear partition that contributes dominantly to the AP. It is concluded that response contributions from the narrow bands with a central frequency near the toneburst frequency show the most adaptation. The change in amplitude for narrow-band responses under increased masking is similar to that for stimulus attenuation. It seems, however, that the underlying masking mechanism is more comparable to the adaptation mechanism. Cooling of the animal did not affect the sharpness of tuning. In all four recording situations there seems to be a decrease in the amount of synchronization of single-fibre responses as reflected in the width of narrow-band action potentials. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

Experiments examined the effects of rnasker level, frequency, and duration (T.), as well as interstimulus interval (At{\}}. Results are consistent with the interpretation that amplitude of N l reflects activity of a limited group of fibers with CF near the probe frequency. For single fibers, decrement in discharge rate (relative to an unmasked condition) is dependent upon rate to the masker [Smith, Neurophys. 40 (1977{\}}]. For the AP, decrement in probe-elicited amplitude should reflect the rate to the masker in those fibers excited by the probe. Thus measurements of Nt decrement uersus masker frequency and level are similar to single unit rate • ersus level funetiuns. Since decrement in 2V 1 reflects amount of adaptation, increasing Ta decreases probe response. Art amplitude as a function of T. thus resembles PST histograms of nerve fibers. Finally, plots ofN t amplitude as a function of At are interpreted as a measure of recovery from adaptation.},

@article{verschooten2012,
abstract = {Frequency selectivity is a fundamental cochlear property. Recent studies using otoacoustic emissions and psychophysical forward masking suggest that frequency selectivity is sharper in human than in common laboratory species. This has been disputed based on reports using compound action potentials (CAPs), which reflect activity in the auditory nerve and can be measured in humans. Comparative data of CAPs, obtained with a variety of simultaneous masking protocols, have been interpreted to indicate similarity of frequency tuning across mammals and even birds. Unfortunately, there are several issues with the available CAP measurements which hamper a straightforward comparison across species. We investigate sharpness of CAP tuning in cat and chinchilla using a forward masking notched-noise paradigm--which is less confounded by cochlear nonlinearities than simultaneous masking paradigms and similar to what was used in the psychophysical study reporting sharper tuning in humans. Our parametric study, using different probe frequencies and notch widths, shows relationships consistent with those of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). The sharpness of tuning, quantified by Q(10) factors, is negatively correlated with probe level and increases with probe frequency, but the Q(10) values are generally lower than the average trend for ANFs. Like the single fiber data, tuning for CAPs is sharper in cat than in chinchilla, but the two species are similar in the dependence of tuning on probe frequency and in the relationship between tuning in ANFs and CAP. Growth-of-maskability functions show slopes {\textless}1 indicating that with increasing probe level the probe is more susceptible to cochlear compression than the masker. The results support the use of forward-masked CAPs as an alternative measure to estimate ANF tuning and to compare frequency tuning across species.},

abstract = {Before 1964, electrocochleography (ECochG) was a surgical procedure carried out in the operating theatre. Currently, the newest application is also an intra-operative one, often carried out in conjunction with cochlear implant surgery. Starting in 1967, the recording methods became either minimal- or not-invasive, i.e., trans-tympanic (TT) or extra tympanic (ET), and included extensive studies of the arguments pro and con. I will review several valuable applications of ECochG, from a historical point of view, but covering all 75 years if applicable. The main topics will be: (1) comparing human and animal cochlear electrophysiology; (2) the use in objective audiometry involving tone pip stimulation—currently mostly pre cochlear implantation but otherwise replaced by auditory brainstem response (ABR) recordings; (3) attempts to diagnose M{\'{e}}ni{\`{e}}re's disease and the role of the summating potential (SP); (4) early use in diagnosing vestibular schwannomas—now taken over by ABR screening and MRI confirmation; (5) relating human electrophysiology to the effects of genes as in auditory neuropathy; and (6) intracochlear recording using the cochlear implant electrodes. The last two applications are the most recently added ones. The “historical aspects” of this review article will highlight the founding years prior to 1980 when relevant. A survey of articles on Pubmed shows several ups and downs in the clinical interest as reflected in the publication counts over the last 75 years.},
